    it’s a monday, so i have a 9am. it’s a civil engineering class but with a focus on architecture and programming. naturally, i book it to the architecture building. but, i feel enticed to make a quick pit stop before that. at frist. i know what you’re thinking: what’s a washed-up upperclassman doing at frist? well, since you asked, i’m going to get an iced chai and a bagel, thank u very much.
