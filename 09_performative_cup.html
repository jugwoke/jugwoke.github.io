    by the time we had reached the vis building, i had mostly finished my chai. however, i decided to hold onto it so it could be a little performative cup sitting on my desk that i took miniscule sips from throughout class to larp as an academic weapon (they always have a cup of an unspecified hot drink, i don’t make the rules).
